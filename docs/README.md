## Overview  
This project offers an AI-powered platform utilizing Dynexâ€™s compute infrastructure, enabling advanced computations, seamless storage management, and a subscription-based model. Payments are exclusively in DXN tokens, maintaining a decentralized and transparent financial structure.  

---

## Key Features  
- Subscription Tiers:  
  - Three plans with varying API limits and access to premium features.  
  - Extra fees apply for exceeding API requests or compute cycles.  

- Dynamic Resource Management:  
  - In-memory storage on user devices, reducing platform overhead.  
  - Optional Google Drive integration for session storage and retrieval.

- Enhanced Error Handling:  
  - Retry mechanisms for failed requests.  
  - Clear failure messages for various scenarios.

## Pricing & Pay Structure  

Payment Method: DXN Tokens Only  

### 1. Subscription Tiers:  
| Plan        | Price (DXN/Month) | API Limit  | Included Compute Cycles |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Basic           | 50 DXN               | 100 requests   | 10 cycles                   |
| Pro             | 100 DXN              | 500 requests   | 50 cycles                   |
| Enterprise      | 250 DXN              | 2,000 requests | 200 cycles                  |

### 2. Additional Costs  
If usage exceeds the limits within a subscription tier, the following fees will apply:  

#### API Request Overages:  
- 1 DXN per 10 additional API requests beyond the limit.  
- Applied automatically once the limit is reached within the billing period.  

#### Compute Cycle Overages:  
- 5 DXN per additional compute cycle beyond the included cycles.  
- Compute cycles represent heavy workloads (e.g., data analysis, AI model inference).  

#### Self-Replicating Workloads:  
- 10 DXN per replicated instance for high-demand workloads that spawn additional processes.  
- Ensures resource usage remains sustainable within the Dynex ecosystem.

### 3. Storage Management Costs  
- In-Memory Cache: Users provide their own memory storage to reduce infrastructure costs.  
- Google Drive Integration (Optional):  
  - 5 DXN per session to link and access Google Drive for data storage.  
  - Sessions persist for 24 hours.  

---

### 4. Error Handling & Auto-Retries  
- 3 DXN per failed request after three retry attempts.  
- Ensures the platform covers any unexpected compute spikes or failed operations.

---

## System Architecture & Components  
- Front-End UI:  
  - User-friendly forms to manage API requests, subscriptions, and session storage.  
  - Login via Google for Drive integration.  

- Backend Logic:  
  - Dynex-compatible code optimized for resource efficiency and scalability.  
  - Monitoring systems in place to prevent abuse of API requests.  

---

## Error Handling & Monitoring  
- Retry Mechanism:  
  - Automatic retries for failed operations up to three times.  
  - Alerts for users when limits are approaching.  

- Failure Scenarios Covered:  
  - Invalid API request  
  - Exceeded subscription limits  
  - Google Drive access failure  

---

## Deployment Instructions  

1. Prepare the Code Base:  
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed.  
   - Set up your Dynex API keys and enable DXN-only payment processing.  

2. Test the Platform Locally:  
   - Verify the subscription management system is working correctly.  
   - Simulate overages to ensure additional fees apply as expected.  

3. Upload to GitHub:  
   - Create a new public repository on GitHub.  
   - Include all source code, dependencies, and documentation.  

4. Submit to Dynex Marketplace:  
   - Log into your Dynex Marketplace account.  
   - Provide the GitHub repository link for review and testing.  
   - Confirm the subscription tiers and additional charges align with Dynex policies.

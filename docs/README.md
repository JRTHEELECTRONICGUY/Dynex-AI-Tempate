### 2. Additional Costs  
If usage exceeds the limits within a subscription tier, the following fees will apply:  

#### API Request Overages:  
- 1 DXN per 10 additional API requests beyond the limit.  
- Applied automatically once the limit is reached within the billing period.  

#### Compute Cycle Overages:  
- 5 DXN per additional compute cycle beyond the included cycles.  
- Compute cycles represent heavy workloads (e.g., data analysis, AI model inference).  

#### Self-Replicating Workloads:  
- 10 DXN per replicated instance for high-demand workloads that spawn additional processes.  
- Ensures resource usage remains sustainable within the Dynex ecosystem.
